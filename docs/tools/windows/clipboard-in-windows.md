## Clipboard in Windows
[info](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/clipboard-in-windows-c436501e-985d-1c8d-97ea-fe46ddf338c6)

The clipboard is a temporary storage area used by Windows. Information (such as text, files, or folders) can be copied to the clipboard from one program or location and pasted elsewhere. The clipboard can only hold one piece of information at a time, so when you copy something else, it replaces the previous contents.
